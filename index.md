A network, a platform for collaboration and open dialogue, a series of events, open to any young researchers or professionals interested in climate and environmental issues, originating at Columbia University but with a global reach.

## We aim to

Improve interdisciplinary communication by building informal connections between disciplines
Provide a friendly, inclusive, and accessible venue for members to share their work and find collaborators
## We comprise
Hundreds of members (and counting) from different backgrounds, including researchers, grad students, law students, postdocs, and early-career professionals in climate science, energy, health, policy, and law, hailing from four continents.

## We Host
Talks with representatives from domestic and international non-profit organizations involved in humanitarian and policy work (incl. City Atlas, Walking Palms International, International Research Institute for Climate and Society, etc.), panel discussions with interdisciplinary researchers, as well as informal networking events and happy hours.
